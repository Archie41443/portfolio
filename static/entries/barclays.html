        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This workshop was the first of the week and had both streams of work experience in, allowing for a larger
            and more diverse group of people to collaborate with.
            The workshop was primarily led by visitors from Barclays and was filled with a wide range of information and
            tasks.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        It started off with a series of icebreakers to allow everyone to get to know each other.
        Then we moved on to working in small groups to present a solution to an idea that we're all really passionate
        about.
        We then worked on coming up with our own elevator pitches, and then presented them to everyone to gain even more
        of an understanding of each other, as well as work on our presentation skills.
        After that, we had a series of mini workshops from people from both Capgemini about investing, money mules and
        even the apprenticeship program â€” which I was quite interested in.
        To finish off the day, we had a go at a mini client project, which was to create a paper aeroplane that would
        fly the farthest, by also while dealing with changing client requirements.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        One challenge that took a while to get used to was having to deal with the changing client requirements as it
        throws you off guard, and you have to scramble to make something work, though it was extremely fun to try and
        quickly adapt.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Our idea that we presented was an app, which would help young people prevent knife crime.
        It would be able to give them advice on how to avoid it, as well as provide them with an anonymous tip line to
        report any incidents or alert the police before they even happen.
        Furthermore, the paper aeroplane task was extremely fun and challenging, with the client asking for the whole
        plane to be doodled halfway through, and our team's plane came close to
        winning.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
        I found the whole workshop extremely fun and rewarding, and it helped me improve a lot of my skills such as
        presenting and collaborating with others.
        Something I would've done differently was to try and make our presentation more interactive and engaging, though
        that is something I have worked on in the week.
        Below are my notes from the workshop as well as a photo of my paper aeroplane.
