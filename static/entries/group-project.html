        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was one of the final big projects of the week and allowed us to use all of the knowledge we had learnt
            in all the previous workshops in order to produce and present a successful solution to a brief.
            We worked in groups of 3 to design an app or website to solve certain problems for young people.

    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
        Our group's problem was 'Sustainable Living' which was to try and tackle the issue of young people not knowing
        how to live sustainably and care for the environment.
        This is a big issue in today's society, and it is imperative that we teach young people how to mitigate the
        effects of climate change.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        One challenge was ensuring that our app followed the basics of UI/UX and that it was accessible to all groups of
        people.
        However, we were able to overcome this by ensuring that there were settings that allowed them to customise the
        app to their needs, ensuring that they would be able to easily use the interface no matter what.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Our solution was to create an app that would allow young people to find out about the different ways of living
        sustainably and being rewarded for sharing it with others.
        It would work a bit like other popular social media apps, such as Snapchat or Instagram, and you could post
        'EcoSnaps' of sustainable activities that you have done and share it with others.
        In addition, you could work out your carbon footprint and try and reduce it â€” earning you EP or (Eco Points).
        This not only encourages young people to share how to live sustainably but also allows them to be more aware of
        the effects of climate change.
    </p>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
        This project allowed us to showcase all of the knowledge we had learnt throughout the week and to present a
        successful and finished solution to a problem.
        It was a great learning experience, and I am very proud of the final product as well as our presentation, which
        we made sure was engaging by asking questions throughout.
        Below are the images of the whiteboards and wireframes we used for our presentation.
