        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was one of the final big projects of the week and allowed us to use all of the knowledge we had learnt
            in all the previous workshops in order to produce and present a successful solution to a brief.
            We worked in groups of 3 to design an app or website to solve certain problems for young people.

        Our group's problem was 'Sustainable Living' which was to try and tackle the issue of young people not knowing
        how to live sustainably and care for the environment.
