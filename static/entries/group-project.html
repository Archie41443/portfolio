        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was one of the final big projects of the week and allowed us to use all of the knowledge we had learnt
            in all the previous workshops in order to produce and present a successful solution to a brief.
            We worked in groups of 3 to design an app or website to solve certain problems for young people.

    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
        Our group's problem was 'Sustainable Living' which was to try and tackle the issue of young people not knowing
        how to live sustainably and care for the environment.
        This is a big issue in today's society, and it is imperative that we teach young people how to mitigate the
        effects of climate change.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        One challenge was ensuring that our app followed the basics of UI/UX and that it was accessible to all groups of
        people.
        However, we were able to overcome this by ensuring that there were settings that allowed them to customise the
        app to their needs ensuring that they would be able to easily use the interface no matter what.
