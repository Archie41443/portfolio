        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was a workshop led by Isabel Cousins all about the agile methodology and how to use it effectively when
            managing a project.
            It consisted of us splitting off into groups to design a rooftop terrace and present our ideas to the rest
            of the cohort, allowing us to practice group management using agile.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        As stated, our overall aim was to put into practice the agile methodology in order to create a design for a
        sustainable rooftop terrace.
        This would allow us to improve on the essential skills within project management such as staying in scope and
        working within the sprints.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The main challenge was that we were all new to the agile methodology and had to learn how to use it effectively.
        It was quite challenging to get used to the different roles of the group, however, we were able to work together
        efficiently to create a successful solution.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        During the workshop, we were split into groups of 4â€“5, and we each assigned each other a role as stated within
        the methodology:
        Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, and Tester. We then worked together to create our design while also
        practicing the new methodology we learnt.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
        I believe our idea was quite well-thought-out and was able to create a successful solution, however, we could've
        been slightly more organised with who says what on the presentations as there was some time in which no one knew
        who was speaking next.
        This is something to work on for next time, though, and the overall solution was a success.
        Below are the slides that we used for our presentation.
