        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was a workshop led by Isabel Cousins all about the agile methodology and how to use it effectively when
            managing a project.
            It consisted of us splitting off into groups to design a rooftop terrace and present our ideas to the rest
            of the cohort, allowing us to practice group management using agile.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The main challenge was that we were all new to the agile methodology and had to learn how to use it effectively.
        It was quite challenging to get used to the different roles of the group, however, we were able to work together
        efficiently to create a successful solution.
