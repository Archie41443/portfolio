        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was the last workshop of the week led by Nana Akua T-Mensah and was about the world of AI and how it
            can be used to solve problems.
            It was a thoroughly engaging workshop and provided useful insight into what AI is and how to effectively
            make the most of it.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop was packed with a bunch of interactive group activities based around AI.
        It started off with a discussion and a mini debate about what AI is and the types of it, and the potential
        issues that it may create.
        We then moved on to learning about prompt engineering and had a group activity where we were tasked with reverse
        engineering an image and getting the AI to generate the closest image to the original.
        After that, we then moved on to learning about AWS and its services and then used Partyrock to see who could
        generate the best app using AI.
        Finally, we were tasked with designing an app or service ourselves that uses different AWS services to solve a
        problem within an industry.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge was trying to think like a computer to reverse-engineer the prompt.
        The amount of detail you needed to go into to get what you want when writing the prompt was gigantic.
        However, as you'll see, we eventually managed to get it really close to the original image.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Our Partyrock app was a workout generator that would take basic information about your diet, weight, height and
        workout intensity,
        and would output a workout plan that would be tailored to your needs.
        It worked surprisingly well and was able to generate a workout plan that was suited to what the user asked for.
