        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was a project where we were split into groups of 4â€“5 and tasked with researching one of Capgemini's
            projects for a client.
            This would allow us to not only put into practice the knowledge from the previous project management
            workshop and agile methodology workshop, but also develop both our research and presentation skills.

    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
        Our group had decided to research Capgemini's modernisation of HMRC's 'Movement of Money' systems.
        We were tasked with finding out information such as how long the project took, what the main challenges were,
        and what we would've done differently.
        We would then present our findings to the rest of the cohort.
