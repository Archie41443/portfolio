        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was a project where we were split into groups of 4â€“5 and tasked with researching one of Capgemini's
            projects for a client.
            This would allow us to not only put into practice the knowledge from the previous project management
            workshop and agile methodology workshop, but also develop both our research and presentation skills.

    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
        Our group had decided to research Capgemini's modernisation of HMRC's 'Movement of Money' systems.
        We were tasked with finding out information such as how long the project took, what the main challenges were,
        and what we would've done differently.
        We would then present our findings to the rest of the cohort.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        I would say one of the challenges was working remotely on a video call, as it took a bit of time to get used to
        not being able to collaborate with people directly in person.
        However, I believe that eventually we were all able to effectively produce a result even while not being within
        the same space.
        Another challenge was finding the right information, as well as ensuring it was accurate and from a credible
        source.
        As most of the detailed information wasn't released to the public, we couldn't always answer certain questions.
        However, we were still able to find a lot of useful and accurate information on pages such as Capgemini's
        official press releases.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout the task, we successfully collaborated and delegated different areas for everyone to work on, in
        order to make the most of our time, as well as effectively managed our time enough to fit multiple practice
        presentations at the end.
        In addition, to make our presentation even more interactive, we create a Kahoot to test everyone's knowledge at
        the end of the presentation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
        From this task, we all learnt valuable skills on how to effectively research a topic as well as manage a project
        within a short amount of time.
        We also gained a better insight into Capgemini's work and how significant they are to their clients.
        I believe that our presentation was very successful, as everyone was engaged throughout, and we were able to
        clearly communicate our findings.
        Below are our slides that we created as well as a link to the Kahoot we used.
