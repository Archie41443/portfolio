        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was a workshop about chaos engineering and how it is used within the industry.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The main topic of the workshop was chaos engineering, but it also delved into topics about how large companies
        run their apps.
        This was with microservices instead of monoliths, which makes it easier to identify with chaos engineering.
        Our main task was to design an app that would use certain microservices and then research a chaos tool that we
        would be able to use to test it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The main challenge was trying to research all the different chaos tools that we would use to 'break' our app.
        This was due to the heavily technical documentation that was provided and not any user-friendly explanation to
        anyone who didn't know anything about chaos engineering.
        However, we were able to eventually find a tool that could inject latency into our app to test for delays.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Our solution was an app that would ask you what mood you were in and would recommend movies to you depending on
        your mood.
        We then decided, in order to test the app's resilience, we would use Gremlin to inject latency into our app.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, I believe our test plan was well-thought-out, and we had all learned a lot more about how companies
        manage and test their applications.
        In addition, at the end of the workshop, we all did a Kahoot quiz to test our knowledge, and I came third on the
        podium!
