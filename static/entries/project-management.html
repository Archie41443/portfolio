        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This workshop was lead by Bilyana Balkanska and was about the world of project management and all the
            different techniques and methodologies that are used.
            In the end, we were able to put into practice what we had learned with a project.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The workshop consisted of a very detailed and engaging presentation from Bilyana at the start, along with
        splitting the cohort into two teams.
        We all learnt about the different project management techniques such as the waterfall lifecycle, as well as the
        idea of scope management, and ensuing you don't go out of cost, time or quality.
        In addition, we also learnt about PESTLE and how to use it effectively.
        After the presentation, each group (ours being called Spades) was tasked with designing a pop-up café and to
        present our idea to the other group.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        The main challenge at first was being able to compromise within such a large group and decide on what ideas to
        incorporate, though after a while we got the hang of it and were able to include everyone's thoughts while still
        keeping everyone on the same page.
        In addition, while it wasn't a major problem, we did struggle a bit with the time management, ensuring that we
        had time to practice our presentation at the end.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Our solution was to create a sustainable matcha café called Sippin' Green which would be targeted towards young
        people and their love for matcha. During this, we learnt valuable skills to do with managing a large group of
        people as well as presenting to an even larger group of people.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
        I believe our idea and presentation were a success as the 'clients' decided ours was the best group, as well as
        we made sure that our presentation was engaging and interactive.
        Below are some of the notes I took, as well as the whiteboard designs we created for our presentations.
