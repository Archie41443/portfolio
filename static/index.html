    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio is to showcase all the work and progress I made over the week at my Capgemini work experience
        placement, which I have made
        from scratch using static HTML and CSS. <!-- Yes, this was all from scratch :D -->
        Throughout the week, I engaged in a variety of group projects and workshops, allowing myself to gain a wide
        range of skills and experience within IT and Business, such as project management, and gaining a better
        understanding of AI.
        You can click on each entry below to view more information about what I did, as well as view evidence of my
        work.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate and inquisitive A-Level student studying Music, Maths, Computing, and EPQ at the Sixth Form
        College Farnborough.
        I am very driven by technology and find that I have a knack for quickly mastering new technologies and systems.
        I am also a grade 8 musician, and in my spare time I volunteer at a children's charity, teaching young children
        how to play instruments in an ensemble together.
        After college, I wish to partake in a Digital and Technology Solutions Professional/Specialist degree
        apprenticeship.

    <h2>About Capgemini</h2>
    <p>
        I would describe Capgemini as a leading global IT services provider that focuses on digital transformation and
        solving problems with innovative technologies.
        They are known for their expertise in AI, cloud computing, data analytics, and digital engineering as well as
        their experience in the financial sector.
        During my time at Capgemini, I had the pleasure of seeing how a global IT company can work efficiently to
        deliver effective solutions to their clients.
        Such clients include well-known organisations such as Heathrow Airport, Barclays, HMRC, and Scottish Water.
